    User: What is the current temperature in the city Julia Roberts was born in?
    Thought: I need to know where Julia Roberts was born.
    Action: search[Julia Roberts birthplace]
    Observation: Smyrna, Georgia
    Thought: I need to know the current temperature in Smyrna, Georgia.
    Action: search[current temperature Smyrna, Georgia]
    Observation: 72 degrees Fahrenheit
    Thought: I need to tell the user the current temperature in the city Julia Roberts was born in.
    Answer: 72 degrees Fahrenheit

    EXAMPLE

    def system_instructions
      <<~PROMPT
      You are an assistant designed to provide solutions for a user. You are provided with the user's input.
      You run in a loop of thought, action, observation, and reflection until you have a solution for the user.
      You can utilize the following actions to gather more information (name - description):
      #{ tools.map{ |t| t.name + " - " + t.description }.join("\n") }

      You should begin by providing a thought and an action with the necessary input for the action. The action will be
      executed externally, and then you will be called again with the observation returned from the action.
      
      You should then begin the loop again and provide a thought and action.

      If you have a solution for the user, return the solution instead of a new action.
      The final answer should only answer the question without additional information about reasoning or process.

      Examples:
      #{ examples.join("\n\n") }
